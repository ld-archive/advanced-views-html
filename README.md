A collection of HTML templates for Advanced Views to enable post metadata to appear consistently on [**ld-archive.org**](https://ld-archive.org).

## About
The website [ld-archive.org](https://ld-archive.org) makes use of the Advanced Views Plugin for Wordpress.
The site makes use of these views to display meta data within individual production posts.
The views are split up to enable ease of reading and arrangement on the site.
To ensure consistent appearance, the html custom templates are included. 
The html contains twig macros in some places to help keep the code simple and easier to maintain.

- Also I guess technically, ChatGPT. Cause I don't know Twig or HTML very well.
